# BonziBuddy
Bonzi Buddy or the purple monkey is back in CMD!

# What is this ?
Bonzi Buddy (My Execution) is a program that removes the entire system in just 10 seconds! Shutting down in less seconds will not remove your system just files or .dll files.
The program is very, very dangerous
Best to test on a virtual machine like "Virtual Box" Downlaod in releases
Files .ISO (Download Windows) on Discord Link:https://discord.gg/TR5XDAAef5

# How it's working?
How it's working? Easy question! It works like this, if you press 1 it redirects you to the main page of the program, then you enter your name or name.
Bonzi will write "Thanks you% yourname%" to you and you will have to type yes or no.
# Yes
If you type yes then just .R.I.P on your computer.
# No
If you type, it doesn't redirect you to the main menu

# Errors
1. Windows XP Professional - Timeout is not working and shutdown
